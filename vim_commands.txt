This file contains vim commands that I am copying from online as well as my thoughts on the commands and how I think of vim in general. Its really just a scratch pad for real practice. 

Things you should know when reading this:

	- WORDS contain puntuation and symbols
	- words do not

Things you should know about VIM:

	- Yes you can use the arrow keys. They are on every keyboard. Use em.
	- Moving up and down will put you in the nearest spot that it can to your original horizontal position
	- There are lots of shortcuts for moving around but they don't work in insert mode. Only normal mode
	- It will take a while to get used to all the key combos you can use to do similar things. I think VIM takes a lot of getting used to and requires way more thinking than a nomral text editor. At least at first. 
	- Pretty much every movement or edit is a command
	- There are some basic ones that you will get used to. It really does not take that much to get started. I mean you could just go into insert mode and use the arrow keys to get around. It takes a little longer than using the shortcuts but you can still get the job done. 

There are modes in vim.
	
	- normal 
		- this is where you move around
		- hit esc enough times and you will get back her
	- insert
		- this is where you add text
		- I'm writing this right now in insert mode
	- replace
		- like insert but more for cleaning up or changing things

Cursor movement
	- h	- move cursor left
	- l 	- move cursor right
	- j 	- move cursor down
	- k	- move cursor up
		- these are the same as gmail which I am used to

	- w 	- jump forwards to the start of a word
	- W 	- jump forwards to the start of a WORD
	- e 	- jump forwards to the end of a word
	- E 	- jump forwards to the end of a WORD
	- b 	- jump backwards to the start of a word
	- B 	- jump backwards to the start of a WORD

	- 0		- jump to the start of a line
	- ^		- jump to the first non-blank character of a line
	- $		- jump to the end of a line

	- gg	- go to the first line of the document
	- G		- go to the first line of the document
	- 5G	- go to line 5 of the document
	
	- fx 	- jump forward to next occurence of character x
	- tx	- jump forward adjacent to next occurence of character x
	- Fx	- jump backward to previous occurence of character x
	- Tx	- jump backward adjacent to previous occurence of character x

	- )	- jump to next sentence
	- (	- jump to previous sentence
	- }	- jump to next paragraph (or function/block when editing code)
	- {	- jump to previous paragraph (or function/block when editing code)

	- [{	- jump to the open { in code
	- ]}	- jump to the close } in code
  - ^E  - scroll the window down
  - ^Y  - scroll the window up
  - ^F  - scroll down one page
  - ^B  - scroll up one page
  - H   - move cursor to the top of the window
  - M   - move cursor to the middle of the window
  - L   - move cursor to the bottom of the window

	Tip: 	Prefix a cursor movement command with a number to repeat it that many times.
		For example, 4j moves down 4 lines.
	use this to practice:
		var map;
		function initMap() {
  		  map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map'), {
    		    center: {lat: -34.397, lng: 150.644},
    		    zoom: 8
  		});
}

  - i - insert before the cursor
  - I - insert at the Beginning of the line
  - a - insert (append) after the cursor
